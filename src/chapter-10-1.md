The Salary Negotiation Process

The salary negotiation process typically occurs after a job offer has been extended. Here are the typical steps:

1. The employer extends a job offer with a specific salary and benefits package.
2. The candidate considers the offer and decides whether to accept or negotiate.
3. If the candidate decides to negotiate, they request a meeting with the employer to discuss salary and benefits.
4. During the meeting, the candidate presents their reasons for requesting a higher salary or better benefits.
5. The employer considers the candidate's request and either accepts or counters with a different offer.
6. The candidate either accepts the new offer or continues negotiations until both parties reach an agreement.
